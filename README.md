# Data Structures Set Project

This project was written for my CS3610 Data Structures class in Fall of 2022. The purpose of this project was to create a class for a mathematical set. 

The only file I modified was myset.h. Other files were provided by Nasseef Abukamail (professor at Ohio University).

Project can be compiled and run with `make` (this will run all tests in the _TEST folder).
